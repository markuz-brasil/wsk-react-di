## Quickstart

```sh
$ npm install --global gulp
```

This will install Gulp, Bower and Phantomjs globally. Depending on your user account, you may need to gain elevated permissions using `sudo` (i.e `sudo npm install --global gulp`). Next, install the local dependencies Web Starter Kit requires:

```sh
$ npm install
```

That's it! You should now have everything needed to use the Gulp tools in Web Starter Kit.

### Gulp Commands

You can now use Gulp with the following commands to stay productive during development:

#### Build & Optimize

```sh
$ gulp
```

#### Watch For Changes & Automatically Refresh Across Devices

```sh
$ gulp watch serve build
```

Now direct your browser to `http://localhost:3000/`

Build and optimize the current project, ready for deployment. This includes ~ linting as well as image, script, stylesheet and HTML optimization and minification. ~
